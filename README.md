1. GUI for food image segmentation
Implemented an active contour algorithm that allows a user to semi-automatically segment food items in a photograph of multiple foods on a dinner plate. 
Users have the following options: left-click to draw around a food item that subsequently automatically shrinks to wrap to the food boundary; right-click a point within a food item that subsequently automatically grows a contour to its outer boundary; shift-click (either button) to manually drag a contour point to a new location.
